DESCRIPTION : 
OUTPUT : In this task, I designed and developed a fully responsive and interactive news webpage named IndiaNews, which dynamically fetches and displays the latest headlines using a public News API. The core objective was to understand real-time data integration in web development and practice how front-end technologies interact with external APIs to build modern, dynamic user interfaces. The project was entirely built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6), which together enabled the creation of a structured layout, visually appealing styles, and functional interactivity. For development, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the main editor due to its powerful features like syntax highlighting, integrated terminal, extension support, and real-time preview capabilities using the Live Server extension. This setup allowed me to rapidly test and iterate my code in a live browser environment. The website interface is clean, minimalistic, and user-focused. At the top, a navigation menu allows users to select news categories such as Top, Sports, Technology, Politics, World, and Business, simulating a real-world news portal experience. Once a category is selected, the JavaScript code sends an asynchronous request using the fetch() method to the News API, retrieves the latest articles in JSON format, and dynamically populates the webpage with updated content. Each news item is displayed inside a neatly styled card that includes an image, headline, short description, and a “Read More” button that links to the full article. The layout is made fully responsive using flexible grid systems and CSS media queries, ensuring the content adapts beautifully across all screen sizes including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. I followed a mobile-first design approach, which is considered a best practice in modern front-end development. From a technical standpoint, the use of JavaScript's Fetch API, template literals, event listeners, and DOM manipulation methods allowed me to dynamically update the news section based on category selection, without refreshing the entire page. This makes the user experience fast and seamless. I also incorporated basic error handling to ensure graceful fallback behavior if the API request fails or no data is returned. The styling of the website features modern UI elements such as shadows, rounded corners, consistent font usage, spacing, and interactive hover effects on buttons and cards, creating a clean and professional appearance. The "Read More" buttons are styled prominently in red to grab attention and encourage engagement. This project is a practical example of API-driven development, a highly demanded skill in web development today. It has strong real-world applicability for building live news dashboards, content aggregation platforms, blog feeds, or even personalized news apps with user-based filters. It also lays the groundwork for more advanced projects involving user authentication, personalized feeds, bookmarking features, or backend integrations. Through this task, I gained a deeper understanding of how to consume and handle APIs, work with JSON data structures, and create reusable UI components dynamically using JavaScript. I also strengthened my knowledge of responsive web design and efficient coding practices. Overall, this project not only met the task requirements but also demonstrated how static web pages can be transformed into live, interactive, and user-engaging platforms using real-time data from public APIs. It reflects essential front-end development skills and is a solid foundation for future full-stack or API-intensive projects
